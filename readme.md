This is the final (a chess game) Ruby project at The Odin Project, utilizing Test-Driven Development (TDD) and
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), along with some SOLID principles that I learning about at refactoring.guru

Please show them your support whenever you can!

You can run the game with "ruby game.rb" without the quotation marks.

Enjoy! :)
